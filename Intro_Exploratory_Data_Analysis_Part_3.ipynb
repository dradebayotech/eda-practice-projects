There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history.\n","\n","The training-set has 891 examples and 11 input variables + the target variable (survived). We have uploaded the dataset here and can be directly accessed with Pandas read_csv().\n","\n","**Feature Description:**\n","\n","PassengerId - this is just a generated Id of each passenger\n","\n","Pclass - which class did the passenger ride in - first, second or third\n","\n","Name\n","\n","Sex - male or female\n","\n","Age\n","\n","SibSp - were the passenger's spouse or siblings with them on the ship\n","\n","Parch - were the passenger's parents or children with them on the ship\n","\n","Ticket - ticket number\n","\n","Fare - ticket price\n","\n","Cabin\n","\n","Embarked - port of embarkation\n","\n","Survived - did the passenger survive the sinking of the Titanic?\n","\n","\n","**Objective:** The broader objective is to build a model that would predict the survival probability of a person, given their basic features.
